Requests
--------

The encoding of requests is unstable. Each type of request is documented in
this section, with the corresponding type of response. In addition, every
request may be responded to with an Unauthorized response. There is an enforced
limit to the size of each request.

TODO: Do we want to enforce a limit on the size of each response?
